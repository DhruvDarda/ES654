From the graph, we can see that the value of maximum coefficient increases with the increase in the degree which means that the cofficients will be alternatively positive and negative to cover all the points.
this is also visible if we fit the curves, the slope decreses and increases alternatively as there are many local minimas and maximas in the y_pred vs X curve.
The curve basically tries to overfit the points and has high varience as the degree increases.
