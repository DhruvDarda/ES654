From the graph, we see that the coefficients have higher values for smaller datasets for any constant degree, but they tend to converge to a point as the dataset size increase.
Based on the graph, we can conclude that as the number of samples, or say that as the dataset size increses, the value of maximum coefficient decreases for a particular constant degree.

This might be because as the increasing degree makes the model tries to overfit the model, the higher dataset size balances it out and eventually maximum coefficient converges for all degrees after a certain threshold of dataset size.
